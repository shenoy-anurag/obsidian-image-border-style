# Image Border Style (Obsidian Plugin)

With this plugin, you can:

Have nice rounded borders (or not) for images ranging from no-border, to a 2px border all the way to a 32px border.

Features:
- Default border radius is same as one in Notion.
- 9 sizes from no-border to 4XL border radius.
- Lightweight, negligible impact on performance.

## Installing the plugin
Easiest way is to install it from the Obsidian Community Plugin marketplace (currently under review).

Until it's approved by the Obsidian team, the plugin will need to be installed manually.

## Manually installing the plugin
- Go the releases section and download `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` from the latest release.
- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/image-border-style/`.
