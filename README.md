# Image Border Style (Obsidian Plugin)

With this plugin, you can:
- Have nice rounded borders (or not) for images from no-border, to a 2px border all the way to a 32px border.

Default border radius is same as one in Notion.

## Installing the plugin
Easiest way is to install it from the Obsidian Community Plugin marketplace.

## Manually installing the plugin
- Clone this repo.
- Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.
- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
